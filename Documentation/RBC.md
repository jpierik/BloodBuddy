RBC – Red blood cell count
Reference range for adult male: 4.60-6.00 per microliter of blood
Reference range for adult female: 4.00-5.40 per microliter of blood
Red blood cells (also known as erythrocytes) are the cell that carries oxygen around your body. Oxygen is essential to the survival of the organs and tissues in your body. This value is the total red blood cell count per volume of blood. This value paints a picture of how many red blood cells are in your body and whether or not this is the amount a healthy individual should have. This value is often proportional hemoglobin levels. 
Low: Values mean you have less red cells than the average healthy individual. This causes reduced oxygen carrying capacity in your blood. Can correspond to many conditions including anemia, bleeding, malnutrition, or pregnancy. 
High: Values mean your red cell count is high. You have more blood cells than the average healthy individual. This can be caused by a number of issues including dehydration, cigarette smoking, etc…

Hgb – Hemoglobin
Reference value for adult male: 14-18 g/dL
Reference value for adult female: 12-15 g/dL
Hemoglobin is the protein that enables oxygen to bind to red blood cells. This protein gives red cells their characteristic color. Without hemoglobin, red cells cannot do their job of bringing oxygen around the body. One can have a high amount of red cells and still have diminished oxygen carrying capacity if there is little hemoglobin in the body. This value is tested for due to the need to know the status of one’s oxygen carrying capacity. This value often correlates to RBC levels.
Low: Your hemoglobin levels are low. This means you have decreased oxygen carrying capacity around your body. Low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. Low levels can be caused by malnutrition, bleeding, or bone marrow disorders. Often times, menstruating women will have hemoglobin values that vary wildly. 
High: Your hemoglobin levels are high. This means that your oxygen carrying capacity is higher than expected. This is often indicative of your body needing higher oxygen carrying capacity for various reasons. High levels can be caused from a variety of sources. Dehydration, smoking, living at high altitudes with less oxygen, or even pregnancy may cause this value. Often times, menstruating women will have hemoglobin values that vary wildly. 

HCT – Hematocrit
Reference value for adult male: 40-54 %
Reference value for adult female: 35-49 %
A hematocrit measures the percentage of whole blood that is made up of red cells. Whole blood is made up of red blood cells, various types of white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Plasma is the amber fluid in which your blood cells are suspended. Plasma is usually invisible due to the high amount of red cells that obscure amber color of the plasma. When blood is spun through a centrifuge, the plasma becomes visible. The test is done as a quick way to evaluate the ratio between red cells to the rest of the blood. 
Low: Your hematocrit is low. This means your blood cell value to plasma ratio is low. Diseases associated: bleeding, anemia, nutrient deficiencies as well as other diseases
High: Your hematocrit is high. This means your blood cell volume to plasma ratio is very high. This is typically indicative of dehydration, but can be a sign of more serious diseases




MCV – Mean corpuscular volume
Reference value for adult male: 80 – 100 fL
Reference Value for adult female: 80-100 fL
MCV measures the average volume of red cells or how large or small your red cells are. When one has cells that are too large or too small, this can correlate to other health conditions. When cells are too large, they are known as macrocytic and when cells are too small they are known as microcytic. Cells being too large or small are problematic because it can skew important measurements such as hemoglobin or hematocrit measurements. Value can be roughly calculated by diciding Hct by RBC count. This value should mirror mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). 
Low: Your red blood cells are microcytic or too small. Some causes are nutrient intake or absorption problems. Usually, in the absence of qualifying conditions, an abnormal MCV should prompt further testing by physicians. Consult doctor for more information. 
High: Your red blood cells are macrocytic or too large. Some causes can be vitamin B12 deficiency or liver disease. Usually, in the absence of qualifying conditions, an abnormal MCV should prompt further testing by physicians. Consult doctor for more information. 


MCH – Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin
Reference value for adult males: 26-32 pg
Reference value for adult females: 26-32 pg
MCH measures the average weight of hemoglobin in an individual red cell. This is in contrast to Hgb which measures total hemoglobin in the body. This value can be roughly calculated by dividing Hgb by the RBC count and converting to appropriate units. 
Low: Low MCH should correlate with low MCV. Same causes 
High: High MCH correlates with high MCV. Same causes

MCHC- Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
Reference value for adult males: 32-36 g/dL
Reference value for adult females: 32-36 g/dL
Mean cell hemoglobin concentration is a measure of the average concentration of hemoglobin in each cell. Hemoglobin is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout the body. If cells do not have the appropriate amount of hemoglobin, oxygen does not get to where it needs to be. 
Low: Cells that have a low hemoglobin concentration are said to be hypochromic. Hypochomic cells occur in nutrient difficient individuals and/or can be a symptom of more serious diseases. Consult your doctor. 
High: Cells that have a high hemoglobin concentration are said to be hyperchromic. This value rarely occurs. When it does occur, the result should be scrutinized for sources of error. There are few sources which make this value actually occur. One of them is if the patient’s cells form a sphere shape instead of the characteristic disc shape. Consult your doctor to interpret this result. 

RDW – Red cell distribution width 
Reference value for adult males: 11.5-14.5 %
Reference value for adult females: 11.5-14.5 % 
The red cell distribution width is not always reported, but it is used when a physician wants to know the uniformity of the size of a patient’s red blood cells. Red cells that have great variation in their size can indicate more serious health conditions. 
Low: Usually this is of no clinical significance. This means that your cells are very uniform in size. 
High: Indicates that your red cells have a large variation in size. This can be indicative of a mixed population of young and old red cells. Young red cells tend to be larger.
